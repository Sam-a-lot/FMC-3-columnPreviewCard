## Overview

Languages: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap v5.0
I used Frontend Mentor's figma files, and the Responsively app to review changes on different screen sizes.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Link

- Live Site URL: https://fmc-3-column-preview-card.vercel.app/

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap v5.0
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsively
- VSCode

### What I learned

I learned I was totally overthinking how to center the whole thing. 
My solution is slightly different than the FM example, since the left card in the example actually spans the whole width of the container and forming a background for the middle and left cards, causing 2 tiny orange bits to peek through at the rounded corners. It was ugly, so I fixed it. üòÅ

### Continued development

I really need to practice positioning because centering that div took me way too long. Stupid, sexy flexbox...

### Useful resources

- [Responsively](https://responsively.app/) - This app helped me to quickly view how my work would look in different screensizes.
